            <h4>
                Here's a list of some of the topics/technologies I'd like to learn in the near future:
            </h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        HTML/CSS
                        <ul><li>
                            I'd like to get a better sense for what I do and don't know in html and css, focusing on developing a strong foundation on the core technologies before moving to <del>the fun stuff</del> more advanced frameworks and tools.
                        </li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Javascript
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continued vanilla topics including objects, classes, and advanced function techniques</li>
                            <li>Map</li>
                            <li>Reduce</li>
                            <li>Filter</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        React
                        <ul><li>
                            I've dabbled with react in the past, but I've never sat down and made a solid attempt to learn and get used to it. Remedying this is very much something on the list for before graduation.
