                Here's a list of some of the topics/technologies I'd like to learn in the near future:
            </h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        HTML/CSS
                        <ul><li>
                            I'd like to get a better sense for what I do and don't know in html and css, focusing on developing a strong foundation on the core technologies before moving to <del>the fun stuff</del> more advanced frameworks and tools.
                        </li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Javascript
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continued vanilla topics including objects, classes, and advanced function techniques</li>
                            <li><del>Map</del></li>
                            <li><del>Reduce</del></li>
                            <li><del>filter</del></li>
                            <li><del>Arrow functions</del></li>
                            <li><del>Object/array decomposition</del></li>
                            <li>These last two were especially enjoyable to learn and work with, they feel like such natural extensions of the language. I love them.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        React
                        <ul><li>
                            I've dabbled with react in the past, but I've never sat down and made a solid attempt to learn and get used to it. Remedying this is very much something on the list for before graduation.
                        </li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Vue
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                I've started using vue for the front end of <a href="https://github.com/leapwill/cs4485-workshop-scheduler"> my senior design project</a>, and I've enjoyed what I've learned of it. I fully expect to find even more things to love as the project progresses, and I'm excited to see how well-suited vue could be for other projects in my future.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Jamstack
                        <ul>
                            One of my good friends has a passion for devops and the cloud that I've enjoyed watching him grow on our way through college. We've talked a lot about serverless and other similar technologies for hosting and supporting applications, so I have a little exposure to some of the concepts supporting jamstack, but not much first or secondhand exposure to jamstack itself. I'm looking forward to diving into this tool, arguably a whole new paradigm for web hosting and applications, and seeing what all the fuss is about.
