                I want to focus on javascript and python. I think these languages will suit my tastes and provide good prospects for finding a job at some point soon.
                javascript is fun to me because there's so much being done with it, the community is always changing and creating new things to look at and work with (mostly frameworks, for better or worse).
                Additionally, I happen to like the syntax and much of how the language works, It just feels nice to me. As far as jobs, I've always said that web dev (in my idealized little world) lends itself to companies with a community of creatives or innovative people working towards different goals. I realize this is a little naive, but hopefully it proves truer than I might expect. Then you toss in node for other stuff and.... yeah, lots of different paths from there.
                <br> 
                Alternately, and a bit new, I could work on learning ios dev in
                swift. I have no idea what swift is like (guess: similar to c++), but I think mobile dev could be very suiting. Hmm.
