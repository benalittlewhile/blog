            <h1>January 28</h1>
            <p>
                I want to focus on javascript and python. I think these languages will suit my tastes and provide good prospects for finding a job at some point soon.
                javascript is fun to me because there's so much being done with it, the community is always changing and creating new things to look at and work with (mostly frameworks, for better or worse).
                Additionally, I happen to like the syntax and much of how the language works, It just feels nice to me. As far as jobs, I've always said that web dev (in my idealized little world) lends itself to companies with a community of creatives or innovative people working towards different goals. I realize this is a little naive, but hopefully it proves truer than I might expect. Then you toss in node for other stuff and.... yeah, lots of different paths from there.
                <br><br> 
                Alternately, and a bit new, I could work on learning ios dev in
                swift. I have no idea what swift is like (guess: similar to c++), but I think mobile dev could be very suiting. Hmm.

                Write... so... Lots to do for homework at the moment. I think (know) the biggest thing is going to be my ai homework, dealing with various pathing algorithms and strategies. As I understand it so far, the assignment is about universal cost search, greedy best first search, and A*. I think I need a snack before I get started on them... and maybe a nap.

                Ended up being a very good day, some great alone time and studying then a fantastic dnd session with some friends. I've got a lot of plans for that world, looking forward to the story we're all going to tell together.
                On the tech side of things, planning to do a little more of the tutorial at <a href="https://javascript.info">javascript.info</a> and call it a night. Overall a good day, but I'd like to try and get a bit more done tomorrow. Especially homework.

                Javascript has an advanced mode! For special people who know 
                about it! Not really of course, but it's a fun sentiment. 
                Evidently as of es5 javascript broke some stuff with backwards
                compatibility. I'm sure this made many people extremely happy
                and was settled as peacefully as every other holy war in the 
                history of Earth. Regardless, in order to unbreak the old stuff,
                the new stuff was disabled by default, which means we have to 
                enable it when we want to use it. we do this using
            </p>
            <code class="prettyprint">
                "use strict";
            </code>
            <p>
                Noooooooow..... to find out what you can do with it.

                I've got a few hours before the super bowl starts and all hell br- I mean before a bunch of people come over.
                During that time I think I'll work on more of that <a href="https://javascript.info">javascript tutorial </a> I've been working through.

                Not a lot of blog in the past few weeks due to an influx of homework and social obligations, but I finally got a chance to work today! Did a few things actually.
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        Updated my <a href="https://github.com/benalittlewhile/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> repo on github to match my new setup, loving how easy vs code makes it to back everything up to the repo and move to a new system if needed. Also, since I don't think I've said it here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/bonsai.sh">bonsai.sh</a> is far and away my favorite bit of software I've used recently. I love the way it integrates with neofetch, clean and pleasing every time I open a terminal. 10/10 would recommend.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Worked on my networking homework. We're using <a 
                        href="http://mininet.org/">mininet</a> to simulate various 
                        network topologies, and I struggled to get it running 
                        properly on my home server. Both the source and packaged 
                        installs gave me weird errors, which I traced back to 
                        openvswitch but couldn't remedy. I ended up just using 
                        mininet's prebuilt vm image with qemu to run the tests our professor requested. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Started my senior design project! My team is working on
                        a scheduling app for a music institute in Dallas using
                        <a href="https://developers.google.com/optimization">Google OR Tools</a> for optimization. I'll be working with another
                        teammate on the front end of the project, and I'm really
                        looking forward to digging in and making something useful.
                        <br><br> We decided to use Vue as a front end framework for 
                        the app since a) doing input and output by hand for the 
                        kinds of data we're going to be working with would be 
                        extremely taxing, and b) working with components will 
                        allow for a clean, consistent experience that can scale 
                        to whatever the project needs. I personally wanted to 
                        find c) a front end framework that I could really get 
                        into. While I might have preferred React for its wider 
                        industry adoption and, by extension, job prospects, I 
                        think Vue is the better choice for the scale of project 
                        we're targeting.
                        <span title="I fully acknowledge my hubris on this point, but even if it bites me I'll learn something useful">
                            Of course, if we find we need the power of React or
                            another more comprehensive platform, switching over 
                            should be a fairly simple, and educational,
                            experience.
                        </span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Later today I'll finish my machine learning assignment in R 
                and hopefully get to make a little more progress on that js 
                tutorial.

                Adding a page to this site to track the things I want to work on or learn. I think having a nice big poster for all of it will help provide direction for the times I sit down and can't decide what to look at. Of course, a second page means I'm going to need a way to get to it, so a nav bar is in order. Lots of new things, gonna be fun.
