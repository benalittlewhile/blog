        <h1>July 17: Moving to React, pt. 1</h1>
        <p>
          I'm working on moving this site to React! You can find the github repo
          for the update 
          <a href="github.com/benalittlewhile/blog-react">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to add a dynamic, reusable navbar to my site that will
          automatically flag the current page as active for styling purposes.
          Evidently creating reusable html in general requires some framework
          for doing so. I already plan to use react to rebuild the site
          eventually, might as well take this opportunity to do so now.
          <br><br>
          Steps: <br>
          1 - create new repo = done <br>
          because react is chonky and weird and I (probably) can't just share
          the built version directly using github pages, imma need a new repo
          <br><br>
          2 - get setup for react dev = done <br>
          I already have a boilerplate I like in a different repo, so I'll copy
          that in and install everything
          <br><br>
          3 - create a basic react project = done
          To me this means a functional index.html that renders some text using
          a react app. Big kid stuff, to be sure.
          <br>
          Actually, here I can just copy/paste the one from my boilerplate. I'll
          be putting it in /lib for the time being, but I suspect it isn't (by
          convention) supposed to go there.
          <br><br>
          4 - Let's make a navbar = done <br>
          Yay the basic app works! Next step is to try and reacreate the nav
          bar I have on the blog currently.
          <br><br>
          And this is where it gets interesting. The navbar as it exists now
          is just a div, with a bunch of links inside it. The styling makes
          the words look like blocks. This brings me back to my initial
          intention: <br>
          I want to make a navbar that automatically marks the appropriate
          link for the current page as active for styling purposes. I can do
          this in a variety of ways <br>
          - have each block check to see if its own title matches the current
          page title, and if so add/adopt(?) the "active" class <br>
          - have the navbar itself tell a block that it is "active" when
          rendered if the title of the block is the same as the current page
          <br><br>

          I ended up having each individual link check to see if it should be
          active or not. This worked swimmingly.

          <br><br>
          5 - Styling = done <br>
          I laid out the skeleton with components, meaning it's time to make it
          pretty. Because I'm moving over an existing site, I already have all
          the styling done, I just need to import it. I ended up messing around
          for a while trying to get css in js and other silliness to work, but
          as usual the simplest strategy was the easiest: literally just add
          the stylesheet to the html file (and add classNames to all the
          components but shush). Site looks lovely again :D

          <br><br>
          6/end - next steps <br>
          I'm finished for today, but very happy with the progress. My obvious
          next step is to get a second page set up for tolearn, my current plan
          being to just... make another html file... and add a react app to it..
          wild. (I get the feeling this might not be the *best* way to do this,
          so I'll plan for a little research as well)
          <br><br>
          After that I'll need to either copy/paste all my posts over (bad), or
          create a way to programatically add blog posts to the page. I have a
          couple thoughts, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this is done.
          <br>
          edit: a quick search looks like react-router will be perfect!

        <h1>July 14: "Now draw the rest of the 6 months"</h1>
        <p>
          Hoooooly h*ck... it's been a little while now huh. That's on me, I
          really ought to have updated this more over the last... ah... months.
          It's been months. Very eventful ones at that! In no particular (but
          still slightly chronological) order:
        <ul>
          <li>Worldwide pandemic</li>
          <li>Finals
            <ul>Predominantly uneventful, I was prepared and they went well</ul>
          </li>
          <li>Spring break
            <ul>less fun due to covid, but that helped me be productive</ul>
          </li>
          <li>Graduation!!
            <ul>
              I'm now officially graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in
              Computer Science from the University of Texas
              at Dallas!
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Started job searching
            <ul>
              I've recently started applying for web dev jobs around Plano,
              hoping to find something that will let me work primarily in JS.
              React would be especially swell.
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Actually, on that last subject I have a couple new things to mention!
          First, I made <a href="https://github.com/benalittlewhile/c2k20">a
            project</a>! It's mostly a good excuse to dip my feet into mongodb
          and backend express, inspired by a subject I'm extremely passionate
          about: cookies üç™. The site gives everyone a unique, numbered cookie
          to call their very own, using mongodb to keep track of which ones have
          already been assigned. Truly the greatest service.
          <br><br>
          Second, Since I've been seeing ember around lots of job apps I figure
          I should look into it. Same goes for angular (which I suspect is
          because I'm in Dallas), but Ember has a cute gopher mascot so it wins
          on priority.
          <br><br>
          New todos:
        <ul>
          <li>Look at Ember</li>
          <li>More React!</li>
          <li>Add a Projects page to this site
            <ul>ideally implementing a dynamic header bar I can reuse instead of
              manually editing each page</ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="post">
        <h1>February 26</h1>
        <p>
          Adding a page to this site to track the things I want to work on or
          learn. I think having a nice big poster
          for all of it will help provide direction for the times I sit down and
          can't decide what to look at. Of
          course, a second page means I'm going to need a way to get to it, so a
          nav bar is in order. Lots of new
          things, gonna be fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>20 minutes later</i> - That uh... took a lot less time than it
          might have. Thanks css! (Huh, that's a new one)
          <br><br>
          I like the implementation so far, but having to change the headers in
          every page each time I add a new one,
          and copy the header to the new page past that, is going to get tedious
          quickly. I suspect that's running into
          one of the reasons frameworks are so prevalent.
      </div>

          Not a lot of blog in the past few weeks due to an influx of homework
          and social obligations, but I finally got
          a chance to work today! Did a few things actually.
        <ul>

          <li>
            Updated my <a
              href="https://github.com/benalittlewhile/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>
            repo on github to match my new
            setup, loving how easy vs code makes it to back everything up to the
            repo and move to a new system if
            needed. Also, since I don't think I've said it here: <span
              title="Happy little tree in my terminal :)"><a
                href="https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/bonsai.sh">bonsai.sh</a> is
              far and away my favorite bit of software
              I've used recently. I love the way it integrates with neofetch,
              clean and pleasing every time I open a
              terminal. 10/10 would recommend.</span>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Worked on my networking homework. We're using <a
              href="http://mininet.org/">mininet</a> to simulate various
            network topologies, and I struggled to get it running
            properly on my home server. Both the source and packaged
            installs gave me weird errors, which I traced back to
            openvswitch but couldn't remedy. I ended up just using
            mininet's prebuilt vm image with qemu to run the tests our professor
            requested.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Started my senior design project! My team is working on
            a scheduling app for a music institute in Dallas using
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/optimization">Google OR
              Tools</a> for optimization. I'll be working
            with another
            teammate on the front end of the project, and I'm really
            looking forward to digging in and making something useful.
            <br><br> We decided to use Vue as a front end framework for
            the app since a) doing input and output by hand for the
            kinds of data we're going to be working with would be
            extremely taxing, and b) working with components will
            allow for a clean, consistent experience that can scale
            to whatever the project needs. I personally wanted to
            find c) a front end framework that I could really get
            into. While I might have preferred React for its wider
            industry adoption and, by extension, job prospects, I
            think Vue is the better choice for the scale of project
            we're targeting.
            <span
              title="I fully acknowledge my hubris on this point, but even if it bites me I'll learn something useful">
              Of course, if we find we need the power of React or
              another more comprehensive platform, switching over
              should be a fairly simple, and educational,
              experience.
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
        Later today I'll finish my machine learning assignment in R
        and hopefully get to make a little more progress on that js
        tutorial.

          Javascript has an advanced mode!
          Evidently as of es5 javascript broke some stuff with backwards
          compatibility. I'm sure this made many people extremely happy
          and was settled as peacefully as every other holy war in the
          history of Earth. Regardless, in order to unbreak the old stuff,
          the new stuff was disabled by default, which means we have to
          enable it when we want to use it. we do this using
        </p>
        <code class="prettyprint">
                "use strict";
            </code>
        <p>
          Noooooooow..... to find out what you can do with it.

          Write... so... Lots to do for homework at the moment. I think (know)
          the biggest thing is going to be my ai
          homework, dealing with various pathing algorithms and strategies. As I
          understand it so far, the assignment is
          about universal cost search, greedy best first search, and A*. I think
          I need a snack before I get started on
          them... and maybe a nap.
          <br><br>
          Ended up being a very good day, some great alone time and studying
          then a fantastic dnd session with some
          friends. I've got a lot of plans for that world, looking forward to
          the story we're all going to tell
          together.
          On the tech side of things, planning to do a little more of the
          tutorial at <a href="https://javascript.info">javascript.info</a> and
          call it a night. Overall a good day, but I'd like to
          try and get a bit more done tomorrow. Especially homework.

          I want to focus on javascript and python. I think these languages will
          suit my tastes and provide good prospects for finding a job at some
          point soon. javascript is fun to me because there's so much being done
          with it, the community is always changing and creating new things to
          look at and work with (mostly frameworks, for
          better or worse). Additionally, I happen to like the syntax and much
          of how the language works, It just feels nice to me. As far as jobs,
          I've always said that web dev (in my idealized little world) lends
          itself to companies with a community of creatives or innovative people
          working towards different goals. I realize this is a little naive, but
          hopefully it proves truer than I might expect. Then you toss in node
          for other stuff and.... yeah, lots of different paths from there.
          <br><br>
          Alternately, and a bit new, I could work on learning ios dev in
          swift. I have no idea what swift is like (guess: similar to c++), but
          I think mobile dev could be very suiting. Hmm.
