                I want to focus on javascript and python. I think these languages will suit my tastes and provide good prospects for finding a job at some point soon.
                javascript is fun to me because there's so much being done with it, the community is always changing and creating new things to look at and work with (mostly frameworks, for better or worse).
                Additionally, I happen to like the syntax and much of how the language works, It just feels nice to me. As far as jobs, I've always said that web dev (in my idealized little world) lends itself to companies with a community of creatives or innovative people working towards different goals. I realize this is a little naive, but hopefully it proves truer than I might expect. Then you toss in node for other stuff and.... yeah, lots of different paths from there.

                Alternately, and a bit new, I could work on learning ios dev in
                swift. I have no idea what swift is like (guess: similar to c++), but I think mobile dev could be very suiting. Hmm.

                Write... so... Lots to do for homework at the moment. I think (know) the biggest thing is going to be my ai homework, dealing with various pathing algorithms and strategies. As I understand it so far, the assignment is about universal cost search, greedy best first search, and A*. I think I need a snack before I get started on them... and maybe a nap.

                Ended up being a very good day, some great alone time and studying then a fantastic dnd session with some friends. I've got a lot of plans for that world, looking forward to the story we're all going to tell together.
                On the tech side of things, planning to do a little more of the tutorial at <a href="https://javascript.info">javascript.info</a> and call it a night. Overall a good day, but I'd like to try and get a bit more done tomorrow. Especially homework.

                Javascript has an advanced mode! For special people who know 
                about it! Not really of course, but it's a fun sentiment. 
                Evidently as of es5 javascript broke some stuff with backwards
                compatibility. I'm sure this made many people extremely happy
                and was settled as peacefully as every other holy war in the 
                history of Earth. Regardless, in order to unbreak the old stuff,
                the new stuff was disabled by default, which means we have to 
                enable it when we want to use it. we do this using

            <code>
                "use strict";
            </code>
            <p>
                Noooooooow..... to find out what you can do with it.
